File is 8396800 bytes, block size is 4kb.

I have tested several block size, here are the results obtained:
1) BLOCK_SIZE = 1024, time taken by the command is approximately 140ms without synchronization and several minutes with it.
2) BLOCK_SIZE = 4096, time taken by the the command is approximately 54ms without synchronization and 16s with it.
3) BLOCK_SIZE = 16384, time taken by the command is nearly the same as previousl without sync, however, time with sync decreased.

In the first experiment block size is 4 times less than the system's thus for copying it has to refer to the same page several times that takes time.
In the second one the default settings are used, each page is referenced only once, therefore the time has decreased.
In the last experiment time without sync has not decreased significantly because each page is still referenced only once as in in the previous one.

Synchronization takes a lot of time as it causes a lot of system calls to insure that the data is written successfully.
