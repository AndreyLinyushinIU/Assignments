Detection and recovery:
- requires decision for a recovery strategy that may take time
+ a staightforward approach that lets a pcocess to start with no preemtion 

Avoidance:
- processes' requirements should be known to construct a model for algorithm
+ doesn't interrupt processes execution after they started

Prevention:
1) Mutual excludion:
- May cause livelock
+ a straightforward approach - simplicity
2) Hold and wait:
- processes' requirements should be known to construct a model for algorithm
+ a process started will not have to request resources - they are already assigned
3) No preemption:
- cannot be applied in some cases to specific hardware
4) Circular wait:
- cannot be applied in some cases to specific hardware
